## nim-plotly: simple plots in nim

[![Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-blue.svg)](http://brentp.github.io/nim-plotly/plotly.html)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brentp/nim-plotly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brentp/nim-plotly)

This is a functioning plotting library. It supports, *line* (with fill below), *scatter* (with errors), *bar*
, *histogram*, *heatmap*, *candlestick* and combinations of those plot types. More standard types can be added on request.


This is **not** specifically for the javascript nim target (but the
javascript target is supported!).

Internally, it serializes typed `nim` datastructures to JSON that matches what [plotly](https://plot.ly/javascript/) expects.

## Examples

#### Simple Scatter plot

```Nim
import plotly
import chroma

var colors = @[Color(r:0.9, g:0.4, b:0.0, a: 1.0),
               Color(r:0.9, g:0.4, b:0.2, a: 1.0),
               Color(r:0.2, g:0.9, b:0.2, a: 1.0),
               Color(r:0.1, g:0.7, b:0.1, a: 1.0),
               Color(r:0.0, g:0.5, b:0.1, a: 1.0)]
var d = Trace[int](mode: PlotMode.LinesMarkers, `type`: PlotType.Scatter)
var size = @[16.int]
d.marker =Marker[int](size:size, color: colors)
d.xs = @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
d.ys = @[1, 2, 1, 9, 5]
d.text = @["hello", "data-point", "third", "highest", "<b>bold</b>"]

var layout = Layout(title: "testing", width: 1200, height: 400,
                    xaxis: Axis(title:"my x-axis"),
                    yaxis:Axis(title: "y-axis too"), autosize:false)
var p = Plot[int](layout:layout, traces: @[d])
p.show()
```

The `show` call opens a browser pointing to a plot like above, but the actual plot will
be interactive.

## Note about C & JS targets / interactive plots

The library supports both the `C` as well as `Javascript` targets of
Nim. In case of the `C` target, the data and layout is statically
parsed and inserted into a template Html file, which is stored in
`/tmp/x.html`. A call to the default browser is made, which loads said
file. The file is deleted thereafter. 

This static nature has the implication that it is not possible to
update the data in the plots. However, thanks to Nim's ability to
compile to Javascript, this can still be achieved if needed. When
compiling to the `JS` target the native plotly functions are
available, including `react` and `restyle`, which allow to change the
data and / or layout of a plot defined in a `div` container. See the
`fig8_js_interactive.nim` for such an example.

## TODO

+ [X] add .show() method to plot which looks for and opens a browser (similar to python webbrowser module)
+ [X] support multiple axes (2 y-axes supported).
+ [ ] experiment with syntax for multiple plots (https://plot.ly/javascript/subplots/ or use separate divs.)
+ [ ] better side-stepping of https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/7794
+ [ ] convert `%` procs into macros so I don't have to re-write the same code over and over.
+ [ ] more of plotly API
+ [ ] ergonomics / plotting DSL
+ [ ] custom interactivity.
